moged README
------------

Moged stands for “MOtion Graph EDitor”. It is based on the methods
discussed in:

http://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Papers/Gleicher/Mocap/mograph.pdf

I used a lot of stuff to make this, including:

* samples from the CMU motion capture database.
* wxWidgets
* SQLite (as a save format)

BUILDING
--------

make depend && make 

or

make depend && make release


There is no windows build for the moment.
